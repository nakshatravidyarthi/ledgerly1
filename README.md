## Overview
<img alt="AWS Architecture" src="./assets/arch.png">

- The **backend** consists of 3 main services being the **Python based REST API** developed using **FastAPI** for serving requests, performing CRUD operations, a **RDS Postgres** database for data storage and retrieval and a **S3 Bucket** for image storage and hosting.
- The other 5 services consist of **Traefik** as reverse proxy, utilized for automatic SSL provision, log creation and **Prometheus**, **Grafana** for resource usage collection and visualization using custom **log exporters**.
- All of these services are run using **Docker** containers to ensure availability and performance.

Primary Services:
- `services/backend:` This subdirectory consists of the primary backend API for the entire application facilitating user registration, login, image upload and CRUD operations with the database.
- `services/receipt-ocr:` This subdirectory consists of the helper application which extracts relevant data using an LLM from user submitted receipt images and adds these records into the database.
- `monitoring/:` This folder consists of all configurations required for the monitoring systems in place.

# AWS Setup

> [!NOTE]  
> The default architecture is based on AWS services, however all of the services and tooling can be setup within any other cloud platform of choice or self hosted locally as well if required.

All the services except S3 must be setup within the same region in AWS. 

All the services and configurations below adhere to the `AWS Free Tier` for a brand new account upto 12 months.

## ECR

AWS Elastic Container Registry will be used to host the container images to be run on AWS Lambda.

> [!NOTE]  
> AWS Lambda can only run images hosted on private registries in ECR.

- Go to Private registry > Repositories > Create Repository.
- Provide a repo namespace and name and keep the rest as default
- Once the repository is created, select it from the Repositories and go to Actions > Permissions.
- Under Permissions click on Edit Policy JSON and paste the below policy.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "LambdaECRImageRetrievalPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",

---

# Remote Backend Setup

1. Install git. Clone the repository and move the contents of the `monitoring/` folder into the EC2 machine.

```bash
mkdir backend
git clone https://github.com/sourasishbasu/ledgerly.git
mv $HOME/ledgerly/monitoring/* $HOME/ledgerly/docker-compose.yml $HOME/backend
```

2. Create the logs folder and secrets file. Copy contents of `services/backend/env.example` and replace secrets and endpoints into the `.env` file.

```bash
cd backend
mkdir logs
touch .env
```
3. Install [Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

## Database

The default architecture utilizes the free `AWS RDS t4g.micro` instance for hosting the Postgres database. As an alternative a `postgres` container can also be run within `Docker` on an `EC2` machine for the same utility. 

### Default Credentials
`username` - user

`pass` - pass

`DB Name` - testdb

`port` - 5432

`host` - EC2 public IP or RDS Connection URL

### Creating tables

<img alt="AWS Architecture" src="./assets/er.png">

Copy the contents of `services/ledgerly.sql` into the SQL Query Editor within any database tool used for connecting to the postgres container.

## Traefik

Traefik serves as a **reverse proxy** to route HTTP requests to the appropriate backend services. 


- Traefik automatically **detects and routes traffic** to Docker services. Services must explicitly enable routing via labels, ensuring only intended services are exposed within the `Docker Compose` specification.

- **Web traffic** is routed through an HTTP entrypoint on port 80. The API service listens internally on port 5000, which Traefik uses to forward incoming requests.

- **Access logs** are enabled and stored in the ./logs/traefik-access.log file, used by `GoAccess` to create the dashboard

- Handle **HTTPS** for the application by integrating with `Let's Encrypt` for automatic certificate management, simplifying secure communication for all exposed services.

## Monitoring

The Ledgerly backend includes a comprehensive monitoring setup using metrics' exporters, Prometheus and Grafana. This allows user to collect metrics, visualize data, and set up alerts for your application.

> [!NOTE]  
> Due to infrastructure limitations, all monitoring tools are being setup on the same machine as the application services however this deviates from best practices and is not recommended in production.

### Exporters

Services which collect and expose system and application metrics from specific resources or environments, making them available in a format that monitoring and observability systems such as Prometheus can scrape and process.

- **Node Exporter**: Used for collectin hardware and OS-level metrics from a Linux server such as Disk I/O, CPU, Memory usage etc.

- **cAdvisor**: Used for monitoring resource usage and performance metrics for containers.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is used to scrape and store metrics from various endpoints. The configuration for Prometheus is located in `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yaml`.

```bash
hostname -I # Host Private IP
```

Replace EC2 instance's private IP into `backend/prometheus/prometheus.yml` under `node_exporter` and `cAdvisor` job's targets.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: node_exporter
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["<instance-private-ip>:9100"]
```

### Grafana

Grafana is used to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus. The configuration for Grafana datasources is located in `monitoring/grafana/datasources.yml`.

- Login to Grafana website. Go to Dashboards > New > Import
- Go to Import Dashboard with ID. Enter `16310` > Load
- Select Main (Prometheus) as the Data Source if prompted.

### Default Credentials
`username` - admin

`pass` - projectwing

Grafana Dashboard URL: `http://<instance-public-ip>:3000`

<img alt="AWS Architecture" src="./assets/grafana.png">

### GoAccess

Generates an extremely detailed real time HTML report of web traffic of an API such as visitors, hits, geolocation etc.

#### Credentials

`username` - admin

`pass` - projectwing

GoAccess Dashboard URL: `http://<instance-public-ip>:7880`

<img alt="AWS Architecture" src="./assets/goaccess.png">

# Usage

**Set up AWS credentials**:
   Ensure you have your AWS credentials configured. You can do this by setting environment variables or using the AWS CLI.

Run the containers with `Docker Compose`.

```
docker compose up --build --pull missing -d
```

Once the Docker container is up, API will be accessible at `http://<instance-public-ipv4-dns>`.

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed API docs along with examples and template data can be found at [Scalar Docs](https://expense-tracker.apidocumentation.com/).
